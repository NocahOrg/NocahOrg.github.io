# Micah's Projects

The projects here are usually going to be low level or close to the metal. This includes coding in assembly, and developing CPU's using digital logic diagrams.

# MIDOS:

MIDOS is the 32 bit kernel/OS that I've have been working on for the past few months. Everything was made from scratch, including the bootloader. This kernel is not very complex, and it can definitely be improved in many areas. The main goal of this project is to learn how kernels work.

# Custom CPU:

This is a custom 8 bit cpu that I built a while ago. It has a 8 bit address and data bus. This CPU was created on Logisim Evolution. 

This CPU is largely based off [this](http://www.buthowdoitknow.com/but_how_do_it_know_cpu_model.html) design, but has some notable changes.

# 6502 computer system:

This is a 6502 computer system that is essentially a exact replica of [Ben Eaters 6502 computer](https://youtu.be/LnzuMJLZRdU). I do plan on changing many things about this computer.

# Other small projects:

![AtariGame](/Images/AtariGame.png)
[here](/SmallProjects/Atari2600) shows how I made games for the Atari 2600.

![1BitAdder](/Images/1BitAdder.jpeg)
[here](/SmallProjects/LogicGates.md) shows how I made a 1 bit adder from NPN transistors

![CrystalRadio](/Images/CrystalRadio.png)
[here](/SmallProjects/Radio.md) shows how I made a crystal radio (unfinished)

![VideoCard](/Images/VideoCard.jpeg)
[here](/SmallProjects/VideoCard.md) shows how I made a video card (inspired by ben eater). the reason this one is here is because I was unable to finish the project. I understood and built the entire thing but for some reason it wasn't working. I think I have a possible explanation for this. 

# Projects I Plan/Want to do:

The * indicates that I plan on doing them very soon.

- 32 bit cpu / computer. kernel would be written in custom language compiled by custom compiler.
- Create compiler for a simple B type programing language 
- Create ALU or simple cpu from transistors 
- Create Tesla coil / maybe make button change frequencies of the Tesla coil so you can play it like a synth *
- Create a synth / modular synth from scratch (electrical engineering) *
- Create file system for OS *
- Disassemble BIOS / firmware to learn way more how bios works (POST, low level memory management, APCI, bus protocols, etc…) maybe flash custom bios?
- Finish 6502 computer by adding more things to the IO module (random number generator, keyboard, synth / sound card, cassette drive, etc…) 
- Reverse engineer linux kernel (obviously reference sources such as https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/ )
- Create a memristor, battery or NMOS transistor from scratch (inspired by nile reds channel) *
- Make a arp spoofer app for apple tv for connecting to hotel networks
- Learn big O notation and other optimization tactics 
- create bootsector programs
	- create a raycast engine that fits in the bootsector 
	- create a sand sim that fits in the boot sector 
- create a game on MIDOS *
	- the game under MSP430 might be made on MIDOS, currently not sure
- mess around with the MSP430
	- create a game that is a rougelike, but every time you get damaged you get shocked (your tolerance in your health)
- create submarine that can be remotley controlled that also can withstand extreme pressure. Also have enough room for gopro to be in the cockpit *
