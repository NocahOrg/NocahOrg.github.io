# MIDOS

This is a single tasked 32 bit OS I've been working on for the past few months.

The features of this operating system will include:

- A basic shell with commands (mkdir, create, sysinfo, assemble, cd, etc...)
- A basic text editor to create assembly programs
- an assembler to assemble programs
- A system library that allows the user to collect input and output data on to the screen
- ability to store files to Floppy through the FAT12 File system
- ability to install OS on to a HDD on the system from floppy (this sort of mimics the "try ubuntu or install ubuntu" feature)

The github for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/micahwagner/My_OS).
