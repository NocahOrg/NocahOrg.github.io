# MIDOS

This is a single tasked 32 bit OS I've been working on for the past few months.

The features of this operating system include:

- A basic shell with commands (mkdir, create, sysinfo, assemble, cd, etc...)
- A basic text editor to create assembly programs
- an assembler to assemble programs
- A system library to link assembly files to
- graphical interface through the system API
- ability to store files to Floppy through the FAT12 File system
